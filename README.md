Quick Text Copy lets you quickly copy text snippets that you frequently use. Just create a simple file which contains your text, and load it in Quick Text Copy. Selecting an item will automatically copy it to clipboard.

### Usage
 
1. Create a simple text file with no extension or with an extension .txt, .log or .properties.
    * Each **line** in the file corresponds to the snippet that you want to copy.
    * Each **empty line** in the file corresponds to a **separator**.
2. Open the app. It shows up in the menubar as seen in the screenshot. 
3. Load the file you created.
4. Click on any item to automatically copy it to clipboard.
